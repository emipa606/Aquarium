    <label>Elephantnose Fish</label>
    <description>The Elephant Nose is an interesting fish that originates from the Niger River and its tributaries in Western Africa.

    <label>Violet Line Piranha</label>
    <description>The Violet Line Piranhas name is in reference to the unusal purple stripe that runs from the base of the lower jaw over the top of the body. It makes a stunning aquarium fish as it also possesses highly reflective scales, deep orange/red eyes and a compressed, high-bodied shape. Far from widespread in nature or the hobby, it tends to be pricey and highly sought-after when available.</description>

    <description>The Black Piranha is similar to the Red Bellied Piranha in appearance, just much larger and slightly darker in color. Some have grown to 7 pounds. Despite their super-size, they are completely solitary so they won't kill a person whereas if a pack of Red Bellies actually attacks than that can be fatal.</description>

    <label>Wimple Piranha</label>
    <description>This species is not actually a piranha in ichthyologic terms, being monotypic and therefore unique. It was so named due to its general resemblance to true piranha, and the fact that it is quite closely related to Pygocentrus species. Mento means chin, referring to the protruding jaw of the fish.</description>

    <label>Pacu</label>
    <description>Pacu is a common name used to refer to several species of omnivorous South American freshwater serrasalmid fish that are related to the piranha.
