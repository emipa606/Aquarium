    <content>This update adds a larger tank, twice the size as the wide tank as well as a vertical variant of the wide tank.
There is also an option to continually add fish to a tank when possible.
The empty gizmos for selecting fish to add is now capped to one for visibility.

You can now also auto-feed your fish using the Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded-mod as the tanks will draw meals from your pipe-network when connected when needed.
Hope these added features are appreciated!</content>
